# Rodolpho Alves' dotFiles

As you might've guessed from the `.ps1` all over the place... **Those are for my Windows machines!**

## What is a dotfile

Oh, geez. Nice question! Why are you here anyway?

Jking aside, you might want to read up some links such as:

1. https://dotfiles.github.io/
2. https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789

Basically these are all my "common" setup files and dependencies that I'm trying to keep in-sync across the different computers I work on.

## Directory structure

| Directory | What goes into it |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| `.` | Everything that goes to `~` |
| `./powershell` | Powershell Profiles and Snippets |
| `./terminal` | Everything Windows Terminal |
| `./vscode` | VisualStudio Code goodies |
